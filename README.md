# Homerunner

1. The landing page is the homepage with a carousel of photos and associated text. We have included a statement that encourages people to register along with a login button, a mission statement, and a covid response. On the top left-hand corner, we have our logo and on the right, we have buttons that will redirect the user to different pages on our site. 

2. First, the user can read about the founders by clicking on the “ABOUT” button. This will lead the user to a new page on the site where there is a carousel of the founders’ pictures and their statements on why HomeRunner is important. 

3. From there, the user should register for an account by clicking on the “REGISTER” button. After being redirected to the registration page and filling in all the fields, the user must click the “SUBMIT” button at the end of the form. 

4. The user is then redirected to the homepage and a message “Registered!” is displayed. Three additional buttons, "INPUT RESOURCES", "DONATE", and "LOG OUT", pop up at the top right-hand corner of the screen. 

5. The user should then press the “INPUT RESOURCES” to log the location and needs of a homeless person. After filling in all the required information and pressing the “SUBMIT” button, the user is redirected to the homepage.

6. Then, the user can press on the “MAP” button and view the requests that people have made using the input resources function and they should also see their request marked by clicking an icon on the map. If the user sees a request they can complete, they should click on the “DONATE” button. 

7. Once they fill in the donation page’s required fields and submit the form, the request on the map disappears. 

8. If the user has any questions, they can click the “CONTACT” button and fill in the form’s fields.
